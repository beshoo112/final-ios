Haweel - Clean runnable demo
This project is a simplified version that includes:
- lib/main.dart (entry)
- placeholder screens in lib/screens/
- simple ThemeProvider in lib/theme/
- simple NotificationService in lib/utils/

To run:
1. Ensure Flutter SDK is available.
2. Run `flutter pub get`
3. Run `flutter run` or build with your IDE.

This demo removes external complex integrations to allow a clean build.
